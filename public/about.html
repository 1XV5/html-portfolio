<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a college student studying at Lehman College, in pursuit of my Computer Science BS degree.
  My goal is to become a web developer and work for a company that will allow me to grow and learn.
  I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also learning how to use Git and GitHub.
  I am excited to learn more about web development and to create amazing projects. I am also a
  self-taught artist and I enjoy many STEM hobbies such as coding, 3D priting and modeling, and
  electronics. 
</p>

<p>Overtime, I expect to gain enough experience to create a platform that will allow me to share
  my creativity and positivity with the world. I am excited to see where my journey will take me
  and I am excited to see what I will create. I am also excited to see what I will learn and how
  I will grow as a developer. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for me.
